# Communication is **key**
One of the most common use cases while working with an client that has many parts, is agreeing on how they should 
communicate between each other. This might be an easy task when you are working alone, but very important when 
working with others.

A fairly large project can very fast turn into a big pile of spaghetti if one does not agree on a common way of doing
 it.

One of the most important aspects for me is that they way they communicate should be loosely coupled. This is because
 it can very fast become a circular dependency hell! Loosely coupled communication can be achieved in different ways.

In this category I want to highlight the different ways I, together with my teams, have been doing it.
