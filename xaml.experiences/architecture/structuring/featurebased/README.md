# Feature based structure
This differs from View-ViewModel based naming convention by putting every feature inside a folder(namespace).
This is suitable for a bigger project. My example is not that big, but it can definitely grow on this type of 
structure. 

This project contains:
* FriendsList - A master view with a list of friends
* FriendDetail - A detailed view for each friend
