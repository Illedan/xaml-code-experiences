# xaml-code-experiences
A collection of the experiences I have collected during my days of Wpf, while following the MVVM design pattern.

The idea is that I want to use this repository as a lookup when facing different scenarios while developing a Xaml based application. But I would also like to share it with the world! :earth_americas:

> Note: This is mainly written for Wpf, but the principles can be used while developing a mobile application (with Xamarin) as well.
