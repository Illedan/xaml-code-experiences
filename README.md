# xaml-code-experiences
A collection of the experiences I have collected during days of Wpf, while following the MVVM design pattern.


Todo:

Create cateorgies: 
architecture, resources, refactoring ...

create code:
architecture -> naming -> feature vs mvvm naming
resources -> converters -> using markupextension to get better xaml code and to use properties
refactoring -> split a big xaml file into smaller pieces. bad way vs good way
