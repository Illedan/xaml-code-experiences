# xaml-code-experiences
A collection of the experiences I have collected during my days of Wpf, while following the MVVM design pattern.

The idea is that I want to use this repository as a lookup when facing different scenarios while developing a Xaml based application. But I would also like to share it with the world! :earth_americas:

> Note: This is mainly written for Wpf, but the principles can be used while developing a mobile application (with Xamarin) as well.

## Categories

### Architecture :office:

Architecutring a Xaml application.

### Resources :hammer:

Resources (converters etc...), utilities or helpers if you will.

### Refactoring :wrench:

Different ways of creating more maintainable Xaml code.

### Todo: :watch:
create code:
architecture -> naming -> feature vs mvvm naming
resources -> converters -> using markupextension to get better xaml code and to use properties
refactoring -> split a big xaml file into smaller pieces. bad way vs good way
